<p style="text-align: justify;">Life, from a scientific standpoint, is a complex biochemical process governed by physical and chemical principles. It is characterized by self-sustaining biological functions, including metabolism, growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, and adaptation through evolution.</p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Recent Definition of Life (NASA, 2023)
One of the most widely accepted modern definitions comes from NASA, which states:</p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution."</p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This definition emphasizes two key aspects:</p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Self-sustaining chemistry: Life relies on biochemical reactions, such as metabolism, to maintain itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darwinian evolution: Life must have the ability to evolve through genetic variation and natural selection.</p><br>
Characteristics of Life (Modern View)</p><br>
Scientists generally agree that all known life shares the following fundamental characteristics:

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cellular Organization – All living organisms are composed of one or more cells, which serve as the basic units of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Metabolism – Life requires energy to sustain itself through biochemical reactions (e.g., respiration, photosynthesis).
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeostasis – Living systems regulate their internal environments to maintain stable conditions.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growth and Development – Organisms grow and develop following genetic instructions.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reproduction – Life perpetuates itself through asexual or sexual reproduction.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Response to Stimuli – Organisms interact with their environment (e.g., plants growing toward light, animals responding to threats).
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evolution and Adaptation – Life evolves through mutations and natural selection, allowing species to adapt to changing environments.</p><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Life Beyond Earth?</p><br>
Modern research into astrobiology expands the definition of life to include the possibility of alternative biochemical systems. While Earth-based life depends on carbon and water, some scientists explore the potential for silicon-based life or lifeforms thriving in extreme environments like methane lakes on Titan.

Thus, while we understand life in the context of Earth, future discoveries—such as extraterrestrial life—may further refine or expand our scientific definition.
